# Mirza's Kubernetes Projects

Welcome to my personal collection of end-to-end Kubernetes projects. Each folder in this repository contains a self-contained project, including source code, Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, and documentation.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── hello-nginx/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── manifests/
│   └── README.md
├── <another-project>/
│   └── .....
└── README.md  # (this file)
```

## Projects

- **hello-nginx**: Deploys a static HTML site using NGINX on Kubernetes.
- *(Add more projects as you create them!)*

## How to Use

1. Browse to any project directory for its
 specific instructions and manifests.
2. Each project contains its own `README.md` with setup, deployment, and cleanup steps.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
